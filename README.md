# Minecraft Bedrock Default Textures

**NOTICE: This repo contains Minecraft Bedrock default textures files as of version 1.17.10.**

This repository is intended to help you find Minecraft Bedrock default textures pack's files.

# Usage

If you want to use Minecraft Bedrock textures for plugins (PocketMine-MP),

1. the directory separator should be a forward slash (/),
2. don't include `https://github.com/Kygekraqmak/default-textures/blob/master` and
3. don't include the `.png` file type.

**NOTE:** Textures should work even if the Minecraft server does not register or support some vanilla Minecraft items or blocks, because textures are rendered client-side, as long the textures remain unmodified by custom textures.

### Example:

If you want to use `https://github.com/Kygekraqmak/default-textures/blob/master/textures/items/arrow.png`, you should use `textures/items/arrow` in your plugin config/script.
